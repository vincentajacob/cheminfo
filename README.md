## About
Cheminformatics leverages computational methods to solve chemical problems, manage large-scale chemical databases, and predict molecular properties. This repository aims to:

- Provide scripts, tools, and workflows for cheminformatics research.
- Serve as a resource for students and researchers in cheminformatics and related fields.
- Explore the application of IT in cheminformatics, including data storage, analysis, and visualization.

---

## Features
- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Tools for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing chemical data.
- **Molecular Descriptors**: Scripts for calculating molecular properties and descriptors.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing molecular structures and datasets.
- **Database Management**: Methods for storing and querying chemical databases efficiently.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Examples of applying machine learning techniques to chemical datasets.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - RDKit: For cheminformatics and machine learning tasks.
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
  - Scikit-learn: For machine learning.
